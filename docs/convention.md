## Style Guide

TypeDocs can be initialized with `npm run typedoc`; this will pull data from the application using TypeDoc notation similar to JSDoc notation). Ideally, use this style to document your work. You should omit fields that aren't applicable to your function/class. If you're only using a description to define your variables, you should use single line notation: `/** This variable stores X for Y. */`.

``` TS
/**
 * Description of the application goes here.
 * @param parameterName description of parameter.
 * @returns description of what's being returned.
*/
```
